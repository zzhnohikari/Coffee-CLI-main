// fs_watcher.rs — Live file-system watcher for the left Explorer panel.
//
// Coffee CLI's brand promise is "beautified host for AI CLIs". That means
// when a CLI tool (Claude / Codex / etc.) writes, renames, or deletes a
// file in the workspace, the user expects the left tree to reflect it
// *immediately*. Previously the tree only refreshed when the user hit
// commands.fsDelete / fsRename / fsPaste through the context menu —
// every other path (terminal `rm`, editor save, git checkout, CLI
// artifact dump) was invisible.
//
// Approach: subscribe to OS-native fs events via the `notify` crate,
// coalesce bursts with `notify-debouncer-full` (200 ms window), then
// emit `fs-refresh` Tauri events. We always refresh the *parent* of a
// changed path (that's where the entry is listed) and additionally the
// path itself when it is a directory (so an expanded subtree re-lists).
// Refreshing only the parent on file changes mirrors the synthetic
// dispatchFsRefresh calls in Explorer.tsx for manual operations, so OS
// events and right-click menu actions go through the same code path.

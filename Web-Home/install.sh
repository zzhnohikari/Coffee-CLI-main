# Resolve version and binary via coffeecli.com (CF-hosted, China-accessible).
# /version.json?platform=<p> returns the latest release tag ONLY when that
# platform's asset has been uploaded to GitHub Releases. If CI is still
# mid-build (mac ARM usually finishes first, Linux/Windows take longer),
# the endpoint reports an empty version for the not-yet-ready platforms.
# That prevents the earlier race where the version bumped instantly but
# the per-platform binary took another 15 min to appear.
# /download/<platform> is a CF Worker route that proxies the matching
# GitHub Release asset. Keeps the install path off api.github.com so the
# script doesn't stall on a blocked or slow GitHub API from mainland
# networks.

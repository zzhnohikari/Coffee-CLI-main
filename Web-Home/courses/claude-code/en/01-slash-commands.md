# Slash Commands

## Overview

Slash commands are shortcuts that control Claude's behavior during an interactive session. They come in several types:

- **Built-in commands**: Provided by Claude Code (`/help`, `/clear`, `/model`)
- **Skills**: User-defined commands created as `SKILL.md` files (`/optimize`, `/pr`)
- **Plugin commands**: Commands from installed plugins (`/frontend-design:frontend-design`)
- **MCP prompts**: Commands from MCP servers (`/mcp__github__list_prs`)

> **Note**: Custom slash commands have been merged into skills. Files in `.claude/commands/` still work, but skills (`.claude/skills/`) are now the recommended approach. Both create `/command-name` shortcuts. See the [Skills Guide](../03-skills/) for the full reference.

## Built-in Commands Reference

Built-in commands are shortcuts for common actions. There are **60+ built-in commands** and **5 bundled skills** available. Type `/` in Claude Code to see the full list, or type `/` followed by any letters to filter.

### `/team-onboarding` — Teammate Ramp-Up Guide

> **New in v2.1.101**

Use `/team-onboarding` to generate a teammate ramp-up guide from your project's local Claude Code usage. The command inspects your `CLAUDE.md`, installed skills, subagents, hooks, and recent workflows, then produces an onboarding document that helps new developers become productive quickly.

It's a built-in command — nothing to install.

**Usage:**

```bash
claude /team-onboarding
```

The generated guide summarizes:

- Project purpose and key conventions from [`CLAUDE.md`](../02-memory/README.md)
- Available [skills](../03-skills/README.md) and when they are auto-invoked
- Configured [subagents](../04-subagents/README.md) and their responsibilities
- [Hooks](../06-hooks/README.md) that run on common events
- Common workflows newcomers should know about

**Availability:** Shipped in Claude Code v2.1.101 (April 11, 2026).

## Custom Commands (Now Skills)

Custom slash commands have been **merged into skills**. Both approaches create commands you can invoke with `/command-name`:

| Approach | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Skills (Recommended)** | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Current standard |
| **Legacy Commands** | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | Still works |

If a skill and a command share the same name, the **skill takes precedence**. For example, when both `.claude/commands/review.md` and `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` exist, the skill version is used.

### Migration Path

Your existing `.claude/commands/` files continue to work without changes. To migrate to skills:

**Before (Command):**
```
.claude/commands/optimize.md
```

**After (Skill):**
```
.claude/skills/optimize/SKILL.md
```

### Why Skills?

Skills offer additional features over legacy commands:

- **Directory structure**: Bundle scripts, templates, and reference files
- **Auto-invocation**: Claude can trigger skills automatically when relevant
- **Invocation control**: Choose whether users, Claude, or both can invoke
- **Subagent execution**: Run skills in isolated contexts with `context: fork`
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load additional files only when needed

### Creating a Custom Command as a Skill

Create a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-command
```

**File:** `.claude/skills/my-command/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: my-command
description: What this command does and when to use it
---

# My Command

Instructions for Claude to follow when this command is invoked.

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### Frontmatter Reference

| Field | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `name` | Command name (becomes `/name`) | Directory name |
| `description` | Brief description (helps Claude know when to use it) | First paragraph |
| `argument-hint` | Expected arguments for auto-completion | None |
| `allowed-tools` | Tools the command can use without permission | Inherits |
| `model` | Specific model to use | Inherits |
| `disable-model-invocation` | If `true`, only user can invoke (not Claude) | `false` |
| `user-invocable` | If `false`, hide from `/` menu | `true` |
| `context` | Set to `fork` to run in isolated subagent | None |
| `agent` | Agent type when using `context: fork` | `general-purpose` |
| `hooks` | Skill-scoped hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) | None |

### Arguments

Commands can receive arguments:

**All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`:**

```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue by number
---

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards
```

Usage: `/fix-issue 123` → `$ARGUMENTS` becomes "123"

**Individual arguments with `$0`, `$1`, etc.:**

```yaml
---
name: review-pr
description: Review a PR with priority
---

Review PR #$0 with priority $1
```

Usage: `/review-pr 456 high` → `$0`="456", `$1`="high"

### Dynamic Context with Shell Commands

Execute bash commands before the prompt using `!`command``:

```yaml
---
name: commit
description: Create a git commit with context
allowed-tools: Bash(git *)
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

### File References

Include file contents using `@`:

```markdown
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

## Plugin Commands

Plugins can provide custom commands:

```
/plugin-name:command-name
```

Or simply `/command-name` when there are no naming conflicts.

**Examples:**
```bash
/frontend-design:frontend-design
/commit-commands:commit
```

## MCP Prompts as Commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/mcp__github__list_prs
/mcp__github__pr_review 456
/mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

### MCP Permission Syntax

Control MCP server access in permissions:

- `mcp__github` - Access entire GitHub MCP server
- `mcp__github__*` - Wildcard access to all tools
- `mcp__github__get_issue` - Specific tool access

## Installation

### As Skills (Recommended)

Copy to your skills directory:

```bash
# Create skills directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# For each command file, create a skill directory
for cmd in optimize pr commit; do
  mkdir -p .claude/skills/$cmd
  cp 01-slash-commands/$cmd.md .claude/skills/$cmd/SKILL.md
done
```

### As Legacy Commands

Copy to your commands directory:

```bash
# Project-wide (team)
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md .claude/commands/

# Personal use
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp 01-slash-commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

## Creating Your Own Commands

### Skill Template (Recommended)

Create `.claude/skills/my-command/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: my-command
description: What this command does. Use when [trigger conditions].
argument-hint: [optional-args]
allowed-tools: Bash(npm *), Read, Grep
---

# Command Title

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Related files: @package.json

## Instructions

1. First step
2. Second step with argument: $ARGUMENTS
3. Third step

## Output Format

- How to format the response
- What to include
```

### User-Only Command (No Auto-Invocation)

For commands with side effects that Claude shouldn't trigger automatically:

```yaml
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to production
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(npm *), Bash(git *)
---

Deploy the application to production:

1. Run tests
2. Build application
3. Push to deployment target
4. Verify deployment
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|------|---------|
| Use clear, action-oriented names | Create commands for one-time tasks |
| Include `description` with trigger conditions | Build complex logic in commands |
| Keep commands focused on single task | Hardcode sensitive information |
| Use `disable-model-invocation` for side effects | Skip the description field |
| Use `!` prefix for dynamic context | Assume Claude knows current state |
| Organize related files in skill directories | Put everything in one file |

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Solutions:**
- Check file is in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.claude/commands/<name>.md`
- Verify the `name` field in frontmatter matches expected command name
- Restart Claude Code session
- Run `/help` to see available commands

### Command Not Executing as Expected

**Solutions:**
- Add more specific instructions
- Include examples in the skill file
- Check `allowed-tools` if using bash commands
- Test with simple inputs first

### Skill vs Command Conflict

If both exist with the same name, the **skill takes precedence**. Remove one or rename it.

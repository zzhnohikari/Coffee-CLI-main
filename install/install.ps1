# Resolve version and binary via coffeecli.com (CF-hosted, China-accessible).
# /version.json?platform=windows returns the latest release tag ONLY when
# the Windows installer has been uploaded to GitHub Releases. If CI is
# still mid-build, the endpoint returns an empty version, which we treat
# as "no upgrade available yet" — preventing the earlier race where the
# version bumped instantly but the .exe took another 15 min to appear.
# /download/windows is a CF Worker route that proxies the matching GitHub
# Release asset. This keeps the install path off api.github.com so the
# script doesn't stall on a blocked or slow GitHub API from mainland
# networks.
